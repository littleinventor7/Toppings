    <p>Cruises to Japan expose passengers to the unique culture of this country. A visit to the vibrant capital of Tokyo reveals a mix of traditional and modern attractions -- see the Imperial Palace, participate in a tea ceremony or shop in the legendary Ginza district. Japan's natural beauty springs to life in the gardens of Kyoto, where sightseers can also enter Shitennoji Temple, built in 593 and believed to be the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan. Cities like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Okinawa and Iwo Jima are visited for their links to World War II. In Kagoshima, visit the Arimura Lava Observatory for a good look at Mount Sakurajima, an active volcano that's constantly smoking.</p>
